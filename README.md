Hard work tends to be when someone spends a great amount of time completing many things. However,
smart work is when they spend less time and instead focus on completing the right things.

Product Based: 
          A product-based company is one that deals with the innovation and introduction of its own products. The products are generally the ones with high market value. Also, these products have the potential to meet the needs of the customer. They aim to produce top-quality products.
Example:
Amazon is a Product based Company and his product is ->	Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, AmazonFresh, Alexa, Echo, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Appstore, Amazon Drive, etc

Service Based: 
          Service-Based Companies are those that offer solutions to the customers and clients. These are amenities, skills, and expertise, depending on the needs of the clients.

These companies work for other organizations. Because they don’t have their own product, they actually sell the time of their employees to their clients.

TCS is a Service based company and his provide a Consultancy, Engineering and Business Solutions Services.
